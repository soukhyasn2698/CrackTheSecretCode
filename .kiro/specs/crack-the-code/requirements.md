# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Crack the Code is a real-time multiplayer code-cracking game where players compete to guess each other's secret 4-digit codes. The game supports both single-player mode against computer-generated codes and multiplayer mode where friends can play together using room codes. The system provides instant feedback through color-coded responses and maintains real-time synchronization between players.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to play a single-player code-cracking game against the computer, so that I can practice and enjoy the game when no friends are available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player selects single-player mode THEN the system SHALL generate a random 4-digit secret code
2. WHEN a player makes a guess THEN the system SHALL provide color-coded feedback (green for correct position, yellow for wrong position, red for not in code)
3. WHEN a player makes 7 incorrect guesses THEN the system SHALL end the game and reveal the secret code
4. WHEN a player correctly guesses the code THEN the system SHALL display a victory message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to create a multiplayer room with a unique room code, so that I can invite friends to play against me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player clicks "Create Room" THEN the system SHALL generate a unique room code
2. WHEN creating a room THEN the system SHALL require the player to set their 4-digit secret code
3. WHEN a room is created THEN the system SHALL display the room code for sharing
4. WHEN a room is created THEN the system SHALL wait for another player to join before starting the game

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to join an existing multiplayer room using a room code, so that I can play against my friend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player enters a valid room code THEN the system SHALL allow them to join the room
2. WHEN joining a room THEN the system SHALL require the player to set their 4-digit secret code
3. WHEN an invalid room code is entered THEN the system SHALL display an error message
4. WHEN a room is full THEN the system SHALL prevent additional players from joining

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player in a multiplayer game, I want to see real-time updates of my opponent's moves, so that I can follow the game progress and know when it's my turn.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an opponent makes a guess THEN the system SHALL immediately update the current player's view
2. WHEN it's a player's turn THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate this in the interface
3. WHEN an opponent wins THEN the system SHALL immediately notify the current player
4. WHEN the game ends THEN the system SHALL display the final results to both players

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want to receive clear visual feedback for my guesses, so that I can strategically plan my next moves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a digit is in the correct position THEN the system SHALL display it with a green indicator
2. WHEN a digit exists in the code but is in the wrong position THEN the system SHALL display it with a yellow indicator
3. WHEN a digit does not exist in the secret code THEN the system SHALL display it with a red indicator
4. WHEN feedback is provided THEN the system SHALL maintain a history of all previous guesses and their feedback

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the game to work seamlessly on my mobile device, so that I can play anywhere without needing a desktop computer.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the game on a mobile device THEN the system SHALL display a responsive interface that fits the screen
2. WHEN using touch input THEN the system SHALL respond appropriately to touch gestures
3. WHEN the device orientation changes THEN the system SHALL maintain usability and layout integrity
4. WHEN playing on mobile THEN the system SHALL provide the same functionality as the desktop version

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to enforce proper game rules, so that the gameplay is fair and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting a secret code THEN the system SHALL require exactly 4 digits (0-9)
2. WHEN making a guess THEN the system SHALL require exactly 4 digits
3. WHEN a player reaches 7 attempts THEN the system SHALL end the game
