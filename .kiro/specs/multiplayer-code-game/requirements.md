# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Crack the Code multiplayer game is a real-time competitive puzzle game where players attempt to guess each other's secret 4-digit codes. The system supports both single-player mode against computer-generated codes and multiplayer mode where players can create or join rooms to compete against friends. The game provides immediate visual feedback through color-coded responses and maintains real-time synchronization between players.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to play a single-player code-cracking game against the computer, so that I can practice and enjoy the game when no friends are available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player selects single-player mode THEN the system SHALL generate a random 4-digit secret code
2. WHEN a player submits a 4-digit guess THEN the system SHALL provide color-coded feedback within 1 second
3. WHEN a guess contains a correct digit in the correct position THEN the system SHALL display green feedback for that digit
4. WHEN a guess contains a correct digit in the wrong position THEN the system SHALL display yellow feedback for that digit
5. WHEN a guess contains a digit not in the secret code THEN the system SHALL display red feedback for that digit
6. WHEN a player makes their 10th incorrect guess THEN the system SHALL end the game and reveal the secret code
7. WHEN a player correctly guesses the code THEN the system SHALL display a victory message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to create a multiplayer room with a unique room code, so that I can invite friends to play against me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player selects "Create Room" THEN the system SHALL generate a unique room code
2. WHEN a room is created THEN the system SHALL allow the creator to set their 4-digit secret code
3. WHEN a secret code is set THEN the system SHALL validate it contains exactly 4 digits (0-9)
4. WHEN a room is created THEN the system SHALL display the room code for sharing
5. WHEN a room is created THEN the system SHALL wait for another player to join before starting the game
6. WHEN a room creator sets their code THEN the system SHALL not reveal it to other players

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to join an existing multiplayer room using a room code, so that I can play against the room creator.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player selects "Join Room" THEN the system SHALL prompt for a room code
2. WHEN a valid room code is entered THEN the system SHALL connect the player to that room
3. WHEN an invalid room code is entered THEN the system SHALL display an error message
4. WHEN a player joins a room THEN the system SHALL allow them to set their 4-digit secret code
5. WHEN both players have set their codes THEN the system SHALL start the game
6. WHEN a room is full (2 players) THEN the system SHALL prevent additional players from joining

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a multiplayer player, I want to take turns guessing my opponent's code in real-time, so that we can compete fairly and see each other's progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN it's a player's turn THEN the system SHALL allow only that player to submit guesses
2. WHEN a player submits a guess THEN the system SHALL immediately update both players' screens
3. WHEN a guess is made THEN the system SHALL switch turns to the opponent
4. WHEN a player makes a guess THEN the system SHALL display the guess and feedback in the game history
5. WHEN either player reaches 10 incorrect guesses THEN the system SHALL end the game
6. WHEN a player correctly guesses the opponent's code THEN the system SHALL declare them the winner
7. WHEN the game ends THEN the system SHALL reveal both secret codes to both players

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player using any device, I want the game interface to work properly on both desktop and mobile, so that I can play comfortably regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is accessed on a mobile device THEN the interface SHALL be fully functional and readable
2. WHEN the game is accessed on a desktop THEN the interface SHALL utilize the available screen space effectively
3. WHEN a player interacts with game controls THEN they SHALL be appropriately sized for touch or mouse input
4. WHEN the game displays feedback colors THEN they SHALL be clearly visible on all device types
5. WHEN text is displayed THEN it SHALL be readable without zooming on mobile devices

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want clear visual feedback for my guesses, so that I can strategically plan my next moves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN feedback is displayed THEN green SHALL indicate correct digit in correct position
2. WHEN feedback is displayed THEN yellow SHALL indicate correct digit in wrong position  
3. WHEN feedback is displayed THEN red SHALL indicate digit not present in the secret code
4. WHEN multiple instances of the same digit are guessed THEN the system SHALL provide accurate feedback for each instance
5. WHEN feedback is provided THEN it SHALL be displayed immediately adjacent to the corresponding guess
6. WHEN a game history is shown THEN all previous guesses and their feedback SHALL remain visible
